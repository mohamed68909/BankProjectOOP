# Iâ€™ve been working on a Bank Management System that demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

This system is designed to manage client data, transactions, user authentication, and even currency exchange, divided across different screens, each handling its specific task. Hereâ€™s how I applied OOP principles:

ðŸ”’ Encapsulation: Each screen encapsulates its behavior, exposing only what's necessary to the user.

ðŸ”„ Inheritance: By extending a base class clsScreen, all screens inherit common functionalities, which ensures better code organization and reuse.

âš¡ Abstraction: The user interacts with high-level options like adding a new client or managing transactionsâ€”without needing to understand the complex logic behind the scenes.

ðŸ”„ Polymorphism: This ensures flexibility, allowing each screen to have specialized behaviors while following a unified structure.
